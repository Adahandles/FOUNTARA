-      <p><strong>Bond Proceeds to Liquidity:</strong> When a bond tranche funds, the ADA raised is paired with treasury WTR and deposited into a liquidity pool on a Cardano DEX (such as Minswap or WingRiders). This provides deep trading liquidity for WTR. LP tokens representing the position are held by the Fountara treasury and locked under a 3-of-5 multi-signature script. Fees earned from the pool accrue back to the treasury to support buybacks and future emissions.</p>
+      <p><strong>Bond Proceeds to Liquidity:</strong> On tranche close, ADA is paired with WTR and routed across multiple DEXs (Minswap 40%, WingRiders 30%, SundaeSwap 20%, MuesliSwap 10%) as defined in <code>liquidity_targets</code>. LP tokens from each DEX are locked under the same 3-of-5 multisig. </p>
+      <p><strong>Treasury Returns:</strong> Fees from all pools accumulate in the treasury to fund future emissions, staking rewards, and buyback operations.</p>
+      <p class="muted">This routing model ensures deep liquidity, price stability, and transparency across all major Cardano DEXs.</p>
