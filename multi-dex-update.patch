-      <p>WTR tokens are emitted gradually rather than all at once. At genesis, 50&nbsp;000&nbsp;WTR were minted to the treasury. New WTR enters circulation over a three-year emissions schedule to fund staking rewards, bond interest and community incentives. Emissions decay by roughly 25&nbsp;% each year, balancing early growth with long-term scarcity.</p>
-      <p><strong>Bond Proceeds to Liquidity:</strong> When a bond tranche funds, the ADA raised is paired with treasury WTR and deposited into a liquidity pool on a Cardano DEX (such as Minswap or WingRiders). This provides deep trading liquidity for WTR. LP tokens representing the position are held by the Fountara treasury and locked under a 3-of-5 multi-signature script. Fees earned from the pool accrue back to the treasury to support buybacks and future emissions.</p>
