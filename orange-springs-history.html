      Orange Springs has been valued by humans for centuries. Indigenous peoples likely visited the spring long before European settlers arrived. During the Second Seminole War (1835–1842), a fort named Fort Russell was built nearby as part of the conflict and the U.S. government encouraged settlement through the Armed Occupation Act of 1842【47†L253-L261】. In 1843 John W. Pearson and Senator David Levy Yulee purchased the spring property and turned it into a thriving health resort【47†L261-L267】. By the early 1850s the resort included a large hotel, mills, shops and a church and welcomed visitors who travelled by steamboat and stagecoach to “take the waters”【6†L79-L87】【15†L53-L61】.

      The Civil War disrupted Orange Springs. Pearson organized the Oklawaha Rangers militia and produced arms for the Confederacy【6†L96-L104】. After his death in 1864 and a tax sale in 1875, the resort declined【6†L101-L107】. In the late 19th century the property changed hands several times. In 1912 turpentine entrepreneur James W. Townsend built the two‑story frame house that still stands today【47†L237-L245】. The “Townsend House” served as a seasonal home and base for Townsend’s business but also became a local landmark. Townsend died in 1944 and the house fell into disuse until the 1970s, when his granddaughter restored it and briefly reopened it as a bed‑and‑breakfast inn. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988【34†L49-L57】.

      Although attempts to revive Orange Springs as a tourist destination continued into the early 20th century—promoters even marketed it as a “Fountain of Youth”—they never regained its antebellum popularity【6†L129-L137】. Public swimming at the spring ended around 1990 when a bottled water plant opened on the site【33†L100-L107】. Today, Orange Springs remains quiet but retains its historic structures and rich heritage. The Townsend House is preserved as a private office and historic site, and a state marker commemorates the spring’s storied past【33†L109-L115】.
